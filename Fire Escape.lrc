[00:00.00]Fire Escape
[00:09.77]New York now was nothing but an ice-capade
[00:17.34]A cigarette, A fire-escape
[00:24.27]Walked this line
[00:27.83]With dust in our pockets for the Bedford Station line to take us
[00:38.89]Crazy
[00:42.31]The drunkard playing the Casio
[00:46.25]We're quiet
[00:49.43]Everytime we start starin' up
[00:53.68]And hear all the loneliest crickets play their violins
[01:08.12]Oh, what a shame
[01:11.01]A subway ride was never meant to last
